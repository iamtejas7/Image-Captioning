# Dataset
[flicker8k](https://www.kaggle.com/) images dataset from kaggle

# Project Overview
This project is a combination of CNN and RNN
CNN is used for extracting features from images. Xception Network CNN model is used for extracting features.
RNN is used for training the captions for images. LSTM is used for sequence learning of captions over features of images.
After that both models are merged together which is also called as decoder.
6000 images are used for training

NOTE : I have not pushed dataset and all epoch models due to it's memory size.
